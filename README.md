# Bus_Depot_N-W_Design
Aim of the Project:To design a secure network for Bus Depot
Station.

Objective of the Project:
● Simulate the typical network architecture for "Bus Depot Network" on
packet tracer tool, wherein End User can book the ticket by accessing Bus
Depot website/Application via their own devices
(Desktop/Laptop/Mobile).
● Demonstrate the concept of IP addressing, VLAN segmentation, CIDR,
WLAN using various network devices like Core Switch (L3), Access
Switches, routers, WLAN, Access points, servers and endpoints
(Desktops/Laptops/Mobile devices).

Scope of the Project:
Creating the following:
● Separate segments for WEB, APP and DB
● Separate User segments for various IT and NON-IT department like Billing,
Accounts, Admin etc.
● ISP connectivity to Web Server for End user to connect to
website/application.
9
● WLAN and Wireless access points.

Future Scope of the Project:
Use of Network Firewall to restrict and filter both inbound and outbound traffic
from the network. Also to restrict the access and traffic flow in the internal
network. Use NAT rules to translate the private (not globally unique) addresses
in the internal network into legal addresses (Public IP), before packets are
forwarded to another network.
